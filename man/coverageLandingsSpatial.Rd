\title{Provides graphical outputs which compare the statistical
rectangle where landings occured to the statistical rectangles where
sampling occured. The relative amounts of landings/samples are
shown by i) coloured rectangles for landings, and ii) circles for
sampling.}

\item{commercialVariable}{Landings variable to be assessed}

\item{samplingVariable}{Sampling Variable to be assessed}

\item{catchCat}{Sampling catch category - "Lan", "Dis",or "Catch"}

\item{verbose}{(Optional) Set to TRUE to print more information. Default is
FALSE}
